      <h2 id="race">The Race</h2>
      <p>This is a 5-part adventure race comprising 4 separate activities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A 1.5km river-float on the Illecilewaet,</li>
        <li>A 2km run with your floaty-toy to the drop-site,</li>
        <li>An 8km run through the forests of Revelstoke,</li>
        <li>A rippin' ride down the Pipe Coaster at RMR,</li>
        <li>An 8km bike ride across the flood-plains of the Columbia.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h2 id="format">The Format</h2>
      <p>
        This will be a <strong>team race</strong>, meaning you will be competing
        as groups of 2 to 4, and the clock doesn't stop until your whole team
        crosses the finish-line. This is primarily for safety, since this is a
        totally jenky-ass event featuring hundreds of possible ways to die, so
        hopefully grouping you all up into teams will increase the probability
        that you keep each other alive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, there will be Barkley Marathons-style checkpoints where
        racers will be expected to collect the page of a book corresponding to
        their bib number to prove that they passed every part of the course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="contingencies">Contingencies</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>This race could be cancelled at any time</strong>. There are
        literally hundreds of reasons this thing might fall apart. If it does,
        I'll try to salvage as much of the party as possible, but I guarantee
        nothing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The most dangerous part of this race by far is the river-float, so if
        it's even the tiniest bit too cold or wet this part will be replaced
        with something else stupid (but warmer). I'm not willing to risk anyone
        getting hypothermic. However, the rest of the race should be fine in
        anything but the worst weather.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the event of a total cancellation, I'll return as much of the
        supplies as possible and refund you what I can, but I make no
        guarantees, so you should basically treat this like a non-refundable
        deposit. By registering for this race, you implicitly forgo your right
        to act butthurt if it doesn't go as planned and I don't want to hear any
        whining about it.
      </p>
      <h2 id="afterparty">The After-Party</h2>
      <p>
        The race will end at my house which has a pool and a grill, so stick
        around afterwards for beers, cake, swimming, and the awards ceremony. A
        dinner of weiner-shaped, grilled foods will be provided with race
        registration, as well as a keg.{" "}
        <strong>
          Because it's a Wednesday night and we have neighbours, the music will
          stop at 9 PM and you all need to go home!!!!!!!
        </strong>{" "}
        The mosquitos will start to get bad around 7:30 anyways, so you'll
        probably be happy to leave. Or I guess some stragglers can stay and we
        can move things down to the basement and play pool or something... But
        there isn't room for 25, so hopefully some of you leave.
      </p>
      <h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
      <p>
        There's space on couches here at the house for 3 people. Additionally,
        part of the back yard is separated from the pool-area by a fence, and
        there's room for 3 or 4 tents. If you'd like to crash here the night
        before or after the event, please enquire when you send your
        registration email. These will be offered on a first-come-first-served
        basis. And if we run out of space for you to crash here, you're still
        invited to go out for breakfast the following morning :)
      </p>
      <h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
      <p>
        This race will be super dangerous, and I don't have any insurance. This
        is not an official event, and you're all just here because some idiot
        with no qualifications of any kind except an affinity for tequila asked
        you to show up. If something bad happens, no help of any kind is
        guaranteed. Your participation in this event is an implicit agreement
        that you're at least as supid as the idiot hosting this thing, and
        you're responsible for whatever terrible fate befalls you.
