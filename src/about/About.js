      <h2 id="race">The Race</h2>
      <p>
        This is a 5-stage adventure race comprised of 4 separate activities:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A 1.5km river-float on the Illecilewaet,</li>
        <li>A 2km run with your floaty-toy to the drop-site,</li>
        <li>An 8km run through the forests of Revelstoke,</li>
        <li>A rippin' ride down the Pipe Coaster at RMR,</li>
        <li>An 8km bike ride across the flood-plains of the Columbia.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h2 id="format">The Format</h2>
      <p>
        This will be a <strong>stage race</strong>, meaning the 5 segments will
        be run like 5 separate little races for which your overall time will be
        the sum of your times in each of the segments. This will allow the whole
        gang to group up and laugh at each other periodically throughout the
        day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, this will be a <strong>team race</strong>, meaning you
        will be competing as groups of 2 to 4, and the clock doesn't stop until
        your whole team crosses the finish-line at each segment. This is
        primarily for safety, since this is a totally jenky-ass event featuring
        hundreds of possible ways to die, so hopefully grouping you all up into
        teams will increase the probability that you keep each other alive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="afterparty">The After-Party</h2>
      <p>
        The race ends at my house which has a pool and a grill, so stick around
        afterwards for beers, cake, swimming, and the awards ceremony. A dinner
        of weiner-shaped, grilled foods will be provided with race registration,
        as well as a keg.{" "}
        <strong>
          Because it's a Wednesday night and we have neighbours, the music will
          stop at 9 PM and you all need to go the fuck home!!!!!!!
        </strong>{" "}
        Or I guess some stragglers can stay and we can move things down to the
        basement and play pool or something... But there isn't room for 20, so
        hopefully some of you leave.
      </p>
      <h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
      <p>
        There's space on couches here at the house for 3 people. Additionally,
        part of the back yard is separrated from the pool-area by a fence, and
        there's room for 3 or 4 tents. If you'd like to crash here the night
        before or after the event, please enquire when you send your
        registration email. These will be offered on a first-come-first-served
        basis. And if we run out of space for you to crash here, you're still
        invited to go out for breakfast the following morning :)
