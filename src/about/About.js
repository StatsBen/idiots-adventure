      <p>
        This is a 5-stage adventure race comprised of 4 separate activities:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A 1.5km river-float on the Illecilewaet,</li>
        <li>A 2km run with your floaty-toy to the drop-site,</li>
        <li>An 8km run through the forests of Revelstoke,</li>
        <li>A rippin' ride down the Pipe Coaster at RMR,</li>
        <li>An 8km bike ride across the flood-plains of the Columbia.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h2 id="format">The Format</h2>
      <p>
        This will be a <strong>stage race</strong>, meaning the 5 segments will
        be run like 5 separate little races for which your overall time will be
        the sum of your times in each of the segments. This will allow the whole
        gang to group up and laugh at each other periodically throughout the
        day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, this will be a <strong>team race</strong>, meaning you
        will be competing as groups of 2 to 4, and the clock doesn't stop until
        your whole team crosses the finish-line at each segment. This is
        primarily for safety, since this is a totally jenky-ass event featuring
        hundreds of possible ways to die, so hopefully grouping you all up into
        teams will increase the probability that you keep each other alive.
